# qlik-sense-embed-material

A simple mashup demo using the App Integration (IFrame) and Capability APIs. This shows how easy it can be to integrate Qlik Sense into existing sites and applications.

## Compatibility

Tested working with Qlik Sense June 2017 through September 2019.

## App

The app is a set of simple HTML sheets based on the Material Design Lite template (https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/tree/mdl-1.x/templates/dashboard). As such, the template is licenced under an Apache-2 licence. Aside from this, change whatever you like and reuse as you see fit.

To test the template, copy the qlik-sense-embed-material folder into C:\Users\<username>\Documents\Qlik\Sense\Extensions and browse to http://localhost:4848/extensions/qlik-sense-embed-material/index.html while Qlik Sense Desktop is running. You will need to make a few tweaks to update the mashup paths.

For Qlik Sense Enterprise, zip the qlik-sense-embed-material folder and import it via the QMC or Dev-Hub as an extension.

## Resources

### Executive Dashboard.qvf

The "Executive Dashboard" app is provided with installations of Qlik Sense Desktop by Qlik.

If you have Qlik Sense desktop (and don't already have the app), copy the app to C:\Users\<username>\Documents\Qlik\Sense\Apps, reload the hub, and update the mashup paths.

If you have Qlik Sense Enterprise, import the app via the QMC and update the mashup code and paths.
